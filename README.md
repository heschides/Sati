# Sati — Case Management for Social Services

Sati is a desktop case management application built for social services case managers. 
It helps track clients, document visits and contacts, monitor compliance deadlines, 
and calculate monthly productivity — all in one focused tool designed for daily use.

The name comes from the Pali word for mindfulness and remembrance, reflecting the 
app's purpose: keeping what matters present and accounted for.

## Tech Stack

Sati is a WPF desktop application targeting .NET 10 on Windows.

- **UI Framework:** WPF with strict MVVM architecture
- **MVVM:** CommunityToolkit.Mvvm (ObservableObject, RelayCommand, ObservableValidator)
- **Data Access:** Entity Framework Core 10 with SQL Server LocalDB
- **Dependency Injection:** Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection via IHost
- **Database:** SQL Server LocalDB (local), designed for Azure SQL migration

The architecture follows strict separation of concerns — ViewModels have no knowledge 
of Views, services are injected via constructor DI, and window creation uses the 
factory delegate pattern throughout.
