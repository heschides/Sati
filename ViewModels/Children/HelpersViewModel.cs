OADS requires that the plan reflect the consumer's own goals, preferences, and priorities — not simply a list of services.\n\nThe PCP process typically begins 60 to 90 days before the plan anniversary date. Use Sati's upcoming tasks panel to monitor when each consumer's PCP window is approaching. A late PCP can result in a gap in service authorization, which directly affects the consumer's care."),

OADS expects goals to be meaningful and individualized — avoid generic language like 'maintain current level of functioning.'\n\nGood examples of consumer-driven goals include: 'I want to learn to cook two meals independently by June,' or 'I want to attend a community event at least once a month.' Work with the consumer and their support team to identify goals that are realistic, motivating, and connected to their broader vision for their life."),

OADS reviewers will look for a clear connection between the consumer's SIP scores, their goals, and the services being requested. Services that cannot be justified by the consumer's functional needs or goals are at risk of being denied or reduced during plan review.\n\nCommon waiver services include Home Support, Community Support, Employment Support, Shared Living, Assistive Technology, and waiver-funded goods and services.
