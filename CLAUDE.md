# Sati — Project Briefing for Coding Assistants

Read this file, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and the relevant section of `AGENDA.md`
before making architectural changes.

## What Sati is

Sati is a Maine-focused human-services case-management platform built by Josh, a social-services
case manager and software developer. It began as a WPF desktop application used for real daily
work. Its longer direction is a cloud-based, multi-tenant platform capable of supporting provider
agencies, supervisors, billing staff, reviewers, and eventually state-facing workflows.

The current client targets .NET 10 and uses WPF, CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, EF Core, SQL Server, and
Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting. The solution now contains the root WPF project, `Sati.Api`,
`Sati.Contracts`, `Sati.Persistence`, desktop/domain tests, and cross-platform API integration
tests. `Sati.Persistence` owns the platform-neutral entity model, `SatiContext`, and migration
chain. The WPF project still owns transitional local EF service implementations; that is not the
intended cloud boundary.

## Product direction

Treat the following as governing constraints:

1. Sati is becoming an API-mediated platform with WPF as one client.
2. Distributed clients must not connect directly to Azure SQL or contain database credentials.
3. The API is authoritative for identity, authorization, tenant isolation, validation,
   transactions, audit history, migrations, and integrations.
4. Azure-hosted services should use managed identities and least-privilege access.
5. Submitted clinical and financial records require immutable versions and amendments rather
   than silent overwrites.
6. Tenant isolation, auditability, concurrency, recovery, observability, and automated testing
   are platform foundations, not post-launch enhancements.
7. Demo and Production must remain separate in databases, credentials, service identities,
   deployments, logs, backups, and administrative access. The desktop bootstrap chooser may
   select either environment only through the validated, hard-coded environment mapping.

Do not solve a cloud feature by placing an Azure SQL connection string in the WPF application.
Do not add new direct EF dependencies to ViewModels or distributed-client services.

## Current product areas

- Client caseloads and demographic records
- Service notes and documentation workflow
- Service-day scheduling and prevention of overlapping billable time
- Compliance forms, annual cycles, and quarterly reviews
- Upcoming deadlines and calendar events
- Supervisor dashboards, queues, and approval workflow
- Productivity, incentives, settings, scheduling, and exempt dates
- Comprehensive Assessment authoring
- Contacts and support teams
- Provider directory and assistive-technology requests
- Early billing, claim-line, and 837P generation
- Local AI-assisted note drafting with explicit human acceptance
- Agency incident and health telemetry, with cross-tenant support on a separate identity

The long-term market direction includes Maine waiver and targeted case-management organizations.
Potential future scope includes person-centered plans, client/reportable incident management, EVV,
mobile/offline documentation, authorization/utilization, full claim and remittance lifecycle,
reporting, and state/payer/provider integrations. Do not imply those capabilities already exist.
The incident features that do exist today are operational error telemetry, not reportable-event
management for clients; do not present one as the other.

## Current architecture

Most persistence operations are behind interfaces in `Data/`, with implementations that create a
short-lived `SatiContext` from `IDbContextFactory<SatiContext>` per method. This is useful as a
transition seam. The `SatiContext` type and migration chain live in the platform-neutral
`Sati.Persistence` assembly; the local service implementations remain in the desktop project.

The target transition is:

```text
WPF ViewModel -> IFeatureService -> HttpFeatureService -> Sati.Api
                                                     -> domain/application service
                                                     -> EF Core -> Azure SQL
```

Existing EF service implementations can move behind the API. Do not expose EF entities directly
as network contracts. Introduce narrowly scoped DTOs, especially around `User`, whose persistence
model currently contains password hash and salt fields that must never leave the server.

Methods that accept `userId`, `agencyId`, or similar caller-controlled scope values must never
trust them. As of the 2026-08-14 review every such API route gates on
`TenantAccess.CanAccessUserAsync` before the value reaches a query, and `ValidatedActorFilter`
re-confirms the claimed identity, role, and agency against the database on every request. New
routes must follow that pattern; see `API_AUTHORIZATION.md` for the route inventory and
`API_SECURITY_AUDIT.md` for what has and has not been reviewed. Transitional desktop-local
services repeat the same restrictions rather than relying on the API being the only caller.

Rules that decide permission, billability, approval, or record status belong in
`Sati.Contracts.V1`, which both the desktop client and `Sati.Api` reference, so a rule cannot be
enforced two different ways. Current owners: `BillingComplianceGate`, `MonthlyContactRules`, `BillingRules`,
`ServiceTimeline`, `AuditCsv`, `IncidentHealthScoring`, `JournalEntry`, `ChatAccess`. A second hand-written copy of one of these
rules is a defect, not a convenience.

Pure presentation and local concerns may stay in the client. Any calculation that controls
persistence, permission, approval, billability, or official record status belongs server-side.

## Data environments

- The bootstrap chooser runs before the splash screen or any database connection.
- `My work` maps only to `SatiProduction`; `Demo` maps only to `SatiDemo`.
- Database name and `dbo.SatiDatabaseIdentity` are checked against that selection before login.
- A selected Demo session displays a permanent Demo indicator.
- The original mixed local database is retained as an archive and is not a runtime target.

See `DATABASE_ENVIRONMENTS.md`. Production data must never be copied, queried, transformed, or
uploaded as part of Demo work without explicit authorization.

## Near-term priority

The cloud platform foundation in `AGENDA.md` takes precedence over broad feature expansion. Most of
the original eight-item foundation is now in place; state as of 2026-08-15:

| Foundation item | State |
|---|---|
| ASP.NET Core API and safe contracts | In place. `Sati.Api` + `Sati.Contracts`; no EF entity is a network contract. |
| Server-side authentication, short-lived tokens | In place. JWT, 30-minute lifetime, server-side verification. |
| Tenant ownership and authorization | In place. `TenantAccess` + `ValidatedActorFilter`; inventory in `API_AUTHORIZATION.md`. |
| Audit events, record versions, optimistic concurrency | In place. Append-only `AuditEvent`, `PersonVersion`, `Revision` tokens with typed 409s. |
| Desktop services from EF to HTTP | In place for Demo — every service interface has a `Cloud*` HTTP implementation. Local Production still uses EF by design. |
| Automated tests | In place. 136 desktop and 65 API tests. Controlled migrations remain manual. |
| Azure-hosted Demo with managed identity | Hosted with managed identity. **The nightly reset job is not yet configured** — `DECISIONS.md` describes the intended design, and both checklists still list it as outstanding. Do not describe it as running. |
| Clean-machine packaging | In place and verified through release 1.2.17. |

Remaining foundation work is therefore narrower than the original list: the nightly Demo reset,
controlled migration deployment, legal-hold and retention enforcement (`OPERATIONS.md`), and
external monitoring. Feature work may proceed when it reinforces these boundaries or is explicitly
prioritized.

## Engineering rules

- Preserve unrelated user changes in the dirty worktree.
- Use constructor dependency injection; do not introduce service-locator access.
- Keep ViewModels unaware of Views.
- Use factories for window creation where a window remains the correct UI primitive.
- Keep database contexts short-lived and server-side as the API transition proceeds.
- Put authoritative business rules in one named owner and document cascade points.
- Do not use UI visibility as security.
- Do not log unrestricted note narratives, passwords, tokens, connection strings, or other
  sensitive content.
- Add tests with new authorization, tenancy, billing, audit, migration, and concurrency work.
- Confirm a security or concurrency regression test fails against the unfixed code before keeping
  it. A test that passes either way reports safety it never checked.
- Take a `LatestRequestTracker` identity for any load triggered by selection or navigation, and
  check it before writing to shared UI state.
- Neutralize untrusted values on the way out, not only on the way in. A quoted CSV field still
  executes in a spreadsheet; see `AuditCsv`.
- Record durable design choices in `DECISIONS.md` and deferred work in `AGENDA.md`.
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` when ownership or boundaries change, and `API_AUTHORIZATION.md` when a
  route is added, removed, or rescoped.

## Healthcare and regulatory posture

Sati is not currently represented as HIPAA compliant or production-ready. Azure hosting and use of
HIPAA-eligible services do not themselves establish compliance. Consult `REGULATORY_CONCERNS.md`
before work involving real PHI, OADS review, MaineCare claims, signatures, records retention,
cross-agency access, AI, exports, or external integrations.

The platform must be designed to produce evidence of access control, integrity, auditability,
availability, risk management, and incident response. Regulatory conclusions require review by
qualified counsel, agency stakeholders, and the appropriate Maine authorities.

## Working with Josh

- Lead with the architectural reason and then explain the implementation.
- Be direct when an assumption is unsafe or conceptually incorrect.
- Avoid flattering language and avoid overstating readiness.
- Match complexity to the real risk, but do not treat healthcare security as optional simplicity.
- Preserve accessible design: meaningful automation names, keyboard navigation, screen-reader
  support, non-color status cues, and sensible focus order.
- Track deferred items instead of silently dropping them.

Sati is simultaneously a working tool and the seed of a much larger product. Protect the working
system while deliberately moving the platform boundary in the intended direction.
