/// Nothing advances the hosted database. The desktop runs
/// <c>Database.Migrate()</c>, but only when it is connected straight to SQL —
/// in Demo it goes through this API over HTTP and never touches Azure SQL. This
/// API does not migrate, and the publish script has no database step. So a
/// release that adds a column ships code the database cannot satisfy, and the
/// gap surfaces as a 500 from whichever feature happens to touch the new column
/// first: a provider directory that will not load, an incident channel that
/// cannot record the very failure it exists to report.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This turns that into one legible readiness failure naming the missing
/// objects. It is a detector, not a fix — it deliberately does not alter
/// anything. Applying a schema change to a hosted database stays a decision
/// somebody makes on purpose.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The comparison itself belongs to <see cref="SchemaComparison"/> in
/// <c>Sati.Contracts</c>, shared with the drift report and, later, the migrator's
/// verify step. This check gates readiness on
/// <see cref="SchemaDifference.PreventsQueries"/> only, which is the same set of
/// failures it reported before that rule was extracted: a database column no
/// model knows about breaks the next idempotent script, not the next request, and
/// must not take the API out of service.
