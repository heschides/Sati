///      calendar date. Billing a 9:00–9:15 contact and a 9:10–9:20 contact
///      double-bills ten minutes of one person's time regardless of which
///      clients the notes belong to, so the scope of the rule is the case
///      manager and the date — never the client.
///
/// Both the desktop client and the API evaluate this type. The client uses it to
/// preview and to refuse a save; the API uses it as the enforcing check, because
/// a rule that decides billability cannot be owned by a distributed client.
///
/// Start times are OPTIONAL. Notes recorded before this rule existed carry no
/// start time, and a note without one claims no minutes and conflicts with
/// nothing. Only notes that both carry a start time and hold a status that
/// occupies time participate.
