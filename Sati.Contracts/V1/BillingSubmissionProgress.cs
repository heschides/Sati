/// nothing, and the column that claimed to distinguish them was true on every row. The
/// screen showed a distinction that did not exist.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Four states rather than a finished/unfinished flag, because "not finished" covers
/// three situations a biller treats differently: work that has not been submitted, a
/// rejection that needs correction, and an accepted claim that needs only patience.
/// Sorting those together is what makes a queue ambiguous.

/// <para>
/// <c>Reconciled</c> is included in <see cref="BillingSubmissionProgress.Settled"/> for

/// been matched against a deposit, and no code performs that match. Until then a paid
/// batch settles at <c>Paid</c>, which is the furthest the system can honestly claim.
