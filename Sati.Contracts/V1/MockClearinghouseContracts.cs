/// reconciliation screen cannot be exercised by one whose totals always agree. Each of
/// these drives a state the read models already know how to display and that nothing has
/// ever actually produced.

/// Every scenario emits test interchanges only — ISA15 is <c>T</c> — so anything ingested
/// from them records itself as synthetic without depending on where it ran.
