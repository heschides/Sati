# Sati — Refactor Agenda

A WPF MVVM case-management desktop app built with EF Core, CommunityToolkit MVVM, and SQL LocalDB.

---

## Phase 1 — Fix the Foundation ✅
*Goal: App starts, login works, no crashes*

- [x] Fix double `mainWindow.Show()` in `App.xaml.cs`
- [x] Implement `MainWindowViewModel.Initialize(user)` — store logged-in user, trigger initial load
- [x] Fix `NewUserViewModel` missing null-conditional on `CloseWindowRequested` event
- [x] Make `IUserService` public
- [x] Remove hardcoded seed user from `LoginWindowViewModel`; replace with proper first-run or seeded user via hash path
- [x] Fix `MainPage_Activated` firing `LoadPeopleAsync()` on every focus — load once only
- [x] Add `OnModelCreating` to `SatiContext` with explicit keys and relationships

---

## Phase 2 — Remove Service Locator, Tighten DI ✅
*Goal: No more `((App)Application.Current).Services`*

- [x] Remove service locator from `LoginWindow.xaml.cs`
- [x] Use `Func<T>` factory injection or similar pattern for window creation
- [x] Audit all remaining `GetRequiredService` calls in view code-behind

---

## Phase 3 — Complete Person/Client Management ✅
*Goal: Add, view, edit, delete clients with validation*

- [x] Add edit support to `NewClientViewModel`
- [x] Add input validation using `[NotifyDataErrorInfo]`
- [x] Fix `RemoveSelectedPerson` — currently not awaiting `DeletePersonAsync`
- [x] Eager-load `Forms` and `Notes` in `PersonService.GetAllPeopleAsync`
- [x] Add compliance review dialog on client creation
- [x] EffectiveDate replaced with MM/DD TextBox with CustomValidation and waiver-gating

---

## Phase 4 — Complete Notes Workflow ✅
*Goal: Notes are fully usable — create, edit, delete, filter*

- [x] Add delete note command to `MainWindowViewModel`
- [x] Confirm edit flow works end to end
- [x] Add status filtering (not just text search)
- [x] Unit count / duration display
- [x] Add NoteType (Visit, Contact, Other, Form) with per-type narrative templates
- [x] Add FormType nullable property on Note with migration
- [x] Form note submission triggers MarkFormCompleteRequested popup

---

## Phase 5 — Productivity, Settings, and Scheduler ✅
*Goal: Daily work tracking, configurable settings, monthly scheduler*

- [x] Settings model, migration, ISettingsService/SettingsService
- [x] SettingsWindow fully wired — billing, templates, weekday/holiday exclusion flags
- [x] Settings confirmation dialog on close summarizing changed values
- [x] Scratchpad model/service/migration with auto-save timer
- [x] Incentive model/service/migration with productivity dashboard and progress bar
- [x] Scheduler popup with workday tile grid, month navigation, DaysScheduled persistence
- [x] New month prompt — fires PromptSchedulerRequested when wasCreated is true
- [x] NoteType radio buttons with EnumToBoolConverter

---

## Phase 6 — Forms, Deadlines, and Events Dashboard ✅
*Goal: Core business logic — deadline tracking per client*

- [x] UpcomingEvent record and UpcomingEventService with full computation logic
- [x] Upcoming Tasks panel split into two columns (forms left, visits right)
- [x] Sort radio buttons wired via SortByDate computed property
- [x] Forms checklist bound to real Form entities via ToggleFormCommand
- [x] Compliance flags computed per FormType using GetCurrentCycleForm
- [x] GetCurrentCycleForm on Person model replaces FirstOrDefault throughout
- [x] EnumDescriptionConverter, BoolToVisibilityConverter, InverseBoolConverter
- [x] Description attributes on FormType enum for human-readable display
- [x] Enums moved to top-level namespace — Enums wrapper class removed
- [x] UserId foreign key on Person, GetAllPeopleAsync filtered by userId

---

## Phase 7 — Client Detail View and User Management
*Goal: Per-client deep view, user administration, soft-delete*

- [ ] Per-client detail view — all notes, forms, compliance status, upcoming events scoped to one client
- [ ] User management / admin panel — add, edit, deactivate users
- [ ] Soft-delete recycle bin for notes
- [ ] DataGrid column cleanup — replace AutoGenerateColumns with explicit column definitions

---

## Phase 8 — Polish and Portfolio Packaging
*Goal: Looks good, handles errors gracefully, README exists*

- [ ] Global error handling and user-friendly error dialogs
- [ ] Loading states / busy indicators
- [ ] UI polish — consistent spacing, styles, color scheme
- [ ] README with purpose, setup instructions, screenshots
- [ ] Seed data script for reviewers

---

## Phase 9 — Azure / HIPAA Readiness
*Goal: Production-ready deployment with audit logging and cloud hosting*

- [ ] Migrate from LocalDB to Azure SQL (EF Core provider swap)
- [ ] Audit logging — AuditLog table with SaveChanges override
- [ ] Microsoft Entra ID evaluation for authentication
- [ ] MSIX packaging for deployment
- [ ] Per-agency database isolation strategy
- [ ] Connection string secret management (no plaintext in appsettings.json)

---

## Pre-Release Fixes
*Must address before shipping to team or OADS*

- [ ] Form compliance query — replace remaining FirstOrDefault usage with GetCurrentCycleForm everywhere
- [ ] Annual form regeneration — when anniversary rolls over, generate new Form records for the new cycle
- [ ] First login condition for scheduler prompt — currently `if (wasCreated)` which is correct; verify behavior across month boundaries

---

## Future Roadmap (Post-OADS)
*Ideas parked for v2.0 and beyond*

- [ ] Sati.Core extraction — move models, services, EF context into shared class library
- [ ] Sati.Api — ASP.NET Core Web API exposing note creation and client read endpoints
- [ ] Sati.Mobile — MAUI app for field note entry and upcoming task visibility (Android/iOS)
- [ ] Azure Cognitive Services Speech-to-Text integration for field note dictation
- [ ] reMarkable integration — push visit PDFs to device, pull annotated docs post-visit
- [ ] Scratchpad search window — read-only historical entry viewer
