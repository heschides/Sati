# Sati — Refactor Agenda

A WPF MVVM case-management desktop app built with EF Core, CommunityToolkit MVVM, and SQL LocalDB.

---

## Phase 1 — Fix the Foundation
*Goal: App starts, login works, no crashes*

- [ ] Fix double `mainWindow.Show()` in `App.xaml.cs`
- [ ] Implement `MainWindowViewModel.Initialize(user)` — store logged-in user, trigger initial load
- [ ] Fix `NewUserViewModel` missing null-conditional on `CloseWindowRequested` event
- [ ] Make `IUserService` public
- [ ] Remove hardcoded seed user from `LoginWindowViewModel`; replace with proper first-run or seeded user via hash path
- [ ] Fix `MainPage_Activated` firing `LoadPeopleAsync()` on every focus — load once only
- [ ] Add `OnModelCreating` to `SatiContext` with explicit keys and relationships

---

## Phase 2 — Remove Service Locator, Tighten DI
*Goal: No more `((App)Application.Current).Services`*

- [ ] Remove service locator from `LoginWindow.xaml.cs`
- [ ] Use `Func<T>` factory injection or similar pattern for window creation
- [ ] Audit all remaining `GetRequiredService` calls in view code-behind

---

## Phase 3 — Complete Person/Client Management
*Goal: Add, view, edit, delete clients with validation*

- [ ] Add edit support to `NewClientViewModel`
- [ ] Add input validation using `[NotifyDataErrorInfo]`
- [ ] Fix `RemoveSelectedPerson` — currently not awaiting `DeletePersonAsync`
- [ ] Eager-load `Forms` and `Notes` in `PersonService.GetAllPeopleAsync`
- [ ] Add client detail view

---

## Phase 4 — Complete Notes Workflow
*Goal: Notes are fully usable — create, edit, delete, filter*

- [ ] Add delete note command to `MainWindowViewModel`
- [ ] Confirm edit flow works end to end
- [ ] Add status filtering (not just text search)
- [ ] Unit count / duration display

---

## Phase 5 — Forms, Deadlines, and Events Dashboard
*Goal: Core business logic — deadline tracking per client*

- [ ] Flesh out `Event.cs` domain model
- [ ] Build `FormService` and display upcoming deadlines per client
- [ ] Build upcoming events dashboard — sorted, filtered view of what's due
- [ ] Wire `UpcomingEvents` collection in `MainWindowViewModel`

---

## Phase 6 — Polish and Portfolio Packaging
*Goal: Looks good, handles errors gracefully, README exists*

- [ ] Global error handling and user-friendly error dialogs
- [ ] Loading states / busy indicators
- [ ] UI polish — consistent spacing, styles, color scheme
- [ ] README with purpose, setup instructions, screenshots
- [ ] Seed data script for reviewers
- [ ] Settings — add confirmation dialog on close summarizing changed values before saving.
