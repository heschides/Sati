# Sati — Active agenda

**Consolidated October 8, 2026.** Stable IDs below are current priorities, not new implementation
authorization. Read the topic owner and [readiness registry](docs/readiness/README.md) before work.
Historical completions/releases remain in the [byte-preserved agenda](docs/archive/2026-10-08/AGENDA.md).

## Release 1.3.38 — readiness evidence and service safeguards

**Status:** Source, Demo API, both installers and distribution verified under the October 8
DATT authorization. Final source, embedded build/UI, automated acceptance and documentation
gates passed, including the actual cached-model gate and complete isolated API suite. This
closing record supplies release evidence; the handoff reports its resulting commit after push
and exact remote confirmation. This release covers
the completed bounded worker, billing-export and request/incident/health repair sequence, the
Settings readiness display and canonical documentation/evidence gates. Broader billing lifecycle,
worker fairness/budgets, tenancy, recovery and independent launch review remain open.

| Gate | Current evidence / remaining work |
|---|---|
| Source audit | Audited repair checkpoint `61c6d0453b34d559886c5f4b28278552b46172fb` and verified AI protocol checkpoint `bb2cef87ed64dd30e31bbe0cbbf41def9946bd87` are included in default `master`. Coordinated source release commit `a50a4df611439f2354f02426e8b5d404297b8ab4` pushed; exact remote source and clean tracked checkout confirmed before packaging. |
| Schema | No persistence migration/model, API Data or reset-baseline delta against fetched released default. No cloud migration, capture, reset or firewall action required or performed. |
| Readiness | Sealed reviewed 1.3.38 snapshot uses audited application source `bb2cef8`; independent review confirms the later test-only fixture diff changes no assessed control. All 42 criteria reviewed, unchanged rubric/history, overall 22.0%, agency separation 25.0%, repeat-request handling 26.8%, operations 14.3%; 41 launch checks remain open. Final embedded parser/WPF 58 passed and all four renders inspected. Later hosting evidence is operational evidence for a future assessment. |
| Automated gates | Final full Release build passed with 18 existing warnings and zero errors. Main-project acceptance: desktop 3,017, API 1,197, signatures 119, portal 8 and Carika 4 passed (4,345 total). The desktop's one initial model skip was separately exercised: the unchanged actual-model gate passed all three original scenarios (one test, zero failed/skipped, 4m14s). Final complete API acceptance passed 1,197, failed 0, skipped 0 in 6m36s, including all ten boundary cases; private SQL cleanup passed. Earlier failed/aborted runs remain retained. All privacy assertions and time limits remain unchanged; fixture isolation changes no application control and establishes no earlier timeout cause. Final embedded parser/WPF 58, documentation negative proofs 22, readiness helper 43, preflight helper 9, portal UI 9 and synthetic installer helpers 16 passed. [Model evidence](docs/readiness/work-evidence.md#2026-10-08--datt-local-model-prompt-gate-repair) and [final API acceptance](docs/readiness/work-evidence.md#2026-10-08--final-release-suite-response-start-timeout) own results and limits. |
| Demo API | Publication verified after the one accepted upload: completed real deployment, exact 70 known deployed file hashes and all three public health/version/contract checks. [The canonical environment inventory](DATABASE_ENVIRONMENTS.md#demo-api-1338-publication--october-9-2026-012401-utc) owns current version, ZIP hash, deployment ID and observed health. Initial temporary-ID polling and local verifier failures are retained in working evidence; no upload replay or rollback. |
| Installers | Demo `SatiDemoSetup-1.3.38.exe`: 104,542,208 bytes, SHA-256 `A83823443BC4E5390169F5D7C9E1F1234C8A551EE0214881DBA3B3443C65C052`; all five responsive launches, normal closes, exact 1.3.38.0 and cleanup passed. Local `SatiLocalSetup-1.3.38.exe`: 206,872,617 bytes, SHA-256 `5D01641720FFC97EB5864CDB98C5D505C034052DBCD8AFB4F7012000B031F958`; exact 1.3.38.0, embedded Microsoft signature, integrated security and cleanup passed. Initial Local refusal during simultaneous Demo acceptance was resolved by sequential acceptance of the unchanged artifact. [Artifact/acceptance evidence](docs/readiness/work-evidence.md#2026-10-08--1338-installer-acceptance-and-distribution). |
| Distribution | Both accepted EXEs and their checksum files published with identical final hashes to the exact `Sati Desktop` and `SatiLogica Demo Files` destinations under `C:\Users\SatiLogica\RobinBradleyAMS\SatiLogica - Documents`. Four files verified, no overwrite or alternate location. Cloud-sync receipt and independent external-device acceptance remain unverified. [Exact paths and evidence](docs/readiness/work-evidence.md#2026-10-08--1338-installer-acceptance-and-distribution). |
| Branches/worktree | Agenda branch source fast-forwarded into local master. Older background-worker/Claude branches and detached 1.3.31 worktree retained because active/retention intent is uncertain. No deletion, force, stash or reset. Preexisting assessment helper/TRX scratch retained and excluded. |
| Final evidence | Closing operational evidence and Kudu polling/timestamp guidance updated; final documentation structure and all 22 negative proofs passed, preflight/readiness history passed, sealed readiness/rubric unchanged. [Working evidence](docs/readiness/work-evidence.md#2026-10-08--1338-installer-acceptance-and-distribution) records exact results and limits. The release handoff reports the resulting evidence commit and confirms default remote equality; no self-referential second ledger commit is needed. |

## Release 1.3.37 — source version reference

This heading preserves the release-preflight lookup. Exact release outcomes, commands, hashes and
remaining historical checkpoints belong to the [captured release record](docs/archive/2026-10-08/AGENDA.md),
not this active backlog. The [environment inventory](DATABASE_ENVIRONMENTS.md) records the later
October 8 firewall-removal evidence; historical unchecked release items were not silently closed.

## Current priorities

| Stable ID | Status | Work and acceptance owner |
|---|---|---|
| SATI-TEN-001 | planned | Structural tenant owners/composite constraints and shared/database-per-tenant/hybrid decision; [architecture](docs/architecture/identity.md), [structural review](SATI_STRUCTURAL_REVIEW_2026-09-28.md). Preserve current caseload/capability checks. |
| SATI-WRK-001 | partial; note failure, HTTP deadline, agency paging and daily cache rotation implemented | W8 workload isolation, agency/account fairness, API admission, global/tenant budgets and synthetic multi-host/load proof; [worker handoff](BACKGROUND_WORKERS_HANDOFF.md), [working evidence](docs/readiness/work-evidence.md). |
| SATI-OPS-001 | activation/evidence pending | Watchdog publication, named-owner notification/absence evidence and enabled-worker expectations; [operations](OPERATIONS.md), [readiness](docs/readiness/README.md). |
| SATI-REC-001 | evidence pending | Complete-service recovery, approved RPO/RTO, protected SQL/blob/key inventories, restore/cutover/later-write/external-send reconciliation; [operations](OPERATIONS.md), [readiness](docs/readiness/README.md). |
| SATI-IDEM-001 | investigation/evidence pending | End-to-end command identity: durable scoped request keys and fingerprints, replay/race conflicts, outbox/inbox intent, lease/fencing ownership, ambiguous external sends and provider reconciliation; [protocol baseline](docs/readiness/protocol-baseline.md), [readiness method](docs/readiness/readiness-method.md). Idempotency is assessed separately from source-only assertions or literal exactly-once claims. |
| SATI-BIL-001 | export-error and replay-kind repairs implemented; physical-history R1/full queue/send R2 in progress | Assessment R1/R2 original/correction lifecycle and current compliance release gates; [billing architecture](docs/architecture/billing.md), [October 9 replay repair](CLAIMMD_SANDBOX_RUNBOOK.md#retained-request-replay--local-source-october-9-2026), [policy/review](CLAIMMD_SANDBOX_RUNBOOK.md#transaction-boundary-review--october-9-2026). Replay source evidence does not close the lifecycle or full send-gate work. |
| SATI-SEC-001 | current request/incident/health repair sequence implemented and locally verified; broader sink/admission/security work open | Authenticated expensive-operation/per-actor/IP/validated-agency budgets, distributed login guard, deployed least privilege/redaction and independent review; [logging owner](LOGGING_DESIGN.md), [security review](SECURITY_REVIEW_2026-09-10.md), [API audit](API_SECURITY_AUDIT.md). |
| SATI-GOV-001 | source implemented/runtime gated | Governance activation, approved policy periods and complete storage/recovery adapters; [governance runbook](RECORDS_GOVERNANCE_RUNBOOK.md). Runtime retention stays PolicyOnly. |
| SATI-CLI-001 | evidence pending | External-device/accessibility/mixed-version/clean-install acceptance and supported client/server/schema compatibility; [Demo acceptance](DEMO_ACCEPTANCE.md), [readiness](docs/readiness/README.md). |
| SATI-DB-001 | planned | Incremental model/schema owner consolidation, controlled migration/rollback and bounded summary queries; [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md), [environment procedures](DATABASE_ENVIRONMENTS.md). |
| SATI-DOC-001 | implemented; upkeep required | Canonical documentation owners, stable IDs, dated evidence and no duplicate current inventory; [governance](docs/documentation-governance.md). Validator and mutation checks are required. |

## Current repair sequence — completion handoff

The bounded worker failure/deadline/discovery/cache repairs, billing residual export-error repair,
request exception boundary, incident execution scope and two-check health redaction are locally
implemented and verified. [Working evidence](docs/readiness/work-evidence.md) owns actual results,
failed baselines and limits. This completes the current repair sequence, not the broader active
agenda. Billing R1/full R2, worker budgets/fairness and general security/operational evidence remain
future work.

The incident and health changes and Settings readiness display are included in audited checkpoint
`61c6d04`, committed and pushed to the agenda branch after the completion handoff. Josh's valid October 8 `Invoke DATT!`
invocation now authorizes the bounded release actions in
[the release playbook](RELEASE_PLAYBOOK.md), subject to its gates. These repairs added no schema
migration. Cloud database changes, security settings and Production actions retain their separate
authorization requirements; no release outcome is established by this invocation.

## Next eligible work

**Next eligible item:** SATI-BIL-001

**Eligibility:** Josh adopted P1–P3 ([DEC-0230](docs/decisions/current/2026-10-09-DEC-0230.md))
and then explicitly requested duplicate-claim safeguards and compliance checks. The transaction/
writer review is source evidence; common SQL coordination remains unproved. R1-05 request-kind
replay is implemented with fail-first API/local evidence. Follow
[the standing workflow](AGENTS.md#standing-work-and-documentation-upkeep).

**Bounded slice:** implement the shared retained-content/history projection and
`OriginalClaimReleaseRules` owner for trusted agency/NoteId claim identity and the adopted
Generated/Queued/uncertain/received/nonreceipt matrix. Extend the shared parser to expose F8;
validate original/correction links, controls, period/6R/D9 and receipt provenance. Preserve
damaged physical/uncertain history as held/incomplete facts. Apply the decision at original
generation, queue and immediately before Sending; introduce and prove common transaction
admission across all history writers in a separately verified implementation chunk.

**Dependencies and owners:** read [the billing architecture](docs/architecture/billing.md),
[the sandbox runbook](CLAIMMD_SANDBOX_RUNBOOK.md),
[payer requirements](PAYER_BILLING_REQUIREMENTS.md),
[payer certification](PAYER_BILLING_CERTIFICATION.md),
[regulatory posture](REGULATORY_CONCERNS.md),
[the protocol baseline](docs/readiness/protocol-baseline.md),
[the contingency owner](docs/readiness/multitenancy-contingencies.md) and
[working evidence](docs/readiness/work-evidence.md). Revalidate original export, local `EdiService`,
queue/worker, mock transmission, manual reconciliation, receipt ingestion, `ClaimCorrectionRules`
and `LoadClaimHistoryAsync`. The transaction review revalidated them at documentation checkpoint
`08fc36e`, with unchanged released application source. Read
[the first implementation scope](CLAIMMD_SANDBOX_RUNBOOK.md#transaction-boundary-review--october-9-2026)
and its replay/account/legacy/recovery boundaries. Revalidate source again before editing.

**Required outputs and completion evidence:** the canonical R1-01–R1-10 acceptance matrix requires
fail-first tests through actual seams, legitimate correction/recovery/replay positives, unchanged
retained bytes/effects and late-receipt precedence over nonreceipt. Test malformed/foreign scope,
all-R accepted upload, generic rejection, modes/accounts and exact business identity. Independent
positive histories replace shared-fixture lifecycle contamination. Prove all-writer admission with
deterministic barriers using the guarded private synthetic SQL runner; SQLite/recovery branch
tests are not SQL concurrency evidence. Preserve no-key replay/no-op and stage key wrapping
outside decision transactions with protected revalidation.

**Remaining authorized sequence:** full R2 follows lifecycle integration: trusted system-scoped
current compliance checks for the exact retained original/correction subset at queue and before
Sending, preserving the explicit standing-claim void purpose, amendment financial review and
immutable history. Record the purpose decision and actual race/atomicity results before closure.

**Boundaries and completion evidence:** reversible source changes, isolated synthetic tests and guarded private SQL proof;
commit/push each verified significant chunk to the previously approved Sati repository. No cloud
or working-data access, deployment/migration/publication, security setting, Production action or
real provider call. Preserve sealed readiness/history and unrelated work. General fairness,
structural tenancy, duplicate-service identity, recovery, logging sinks and external certification
retain their separate owners. [Working evidence](docs/readiness/work-evidence.md#2026-10-09--retained-edi-request-kind)
records this slice's results; full lifecycle/send-gate acceptance is still required.

## Preserved open-work inventory

[Legacy open-item registry](docs/backlog/legacy-open-items.md) contains **454** original
unchecked tasks with stable LEG IDs, original text, heading context and original line numbers.
They require revalidation: some old checkboxes conflict with later implemented/superseded records.
No item was dropped or declared fixed merely to shorten this agenda. Promote, merge, supersede or
close each legacy ID only with an explicit disposition, canonical active ID and dated evidence.

Deferred domain/product work remains in its existing canonical topic owner and the legacy registry.
Do not expand into future Karuna/OADS/mobile work just because a historical roadmap mentions it.

## Change discipline

Preserve IDs when wording/status changes. Record owner, acceptance criteria, evidence and reason
for deferral; update readiness separately when activation requires operator/cloud/vendor evidence.
Completed records move to a dated archive with a disposition link, rather than disappearing.
Never use a checked box or aggregate test count as proof of a live service or legal clearance.
